            <Paragraph>
            In the development of MementoOS, my focus was on creating a robust operating system that supports dynamic memory management, sophisticated task management, and efficient inter-task communications alongside comprehensive I/O handling. The core of MementoOS is built on C and ARM architecture, emphasizing multi-threading capabilities, state machines, and a scheduler tailored to facilitate seamless task scheduling and preemption. The kernel of MementoOS is designed to handle multi-tasking efficiently, ensuring tasks are managed properly with dedicated memory ownership to prevent leaks and conflicts. My work in this project significantly enhanced my skills in handling inter-task communications and UART interrupt management. Through the meticulous design and implementation of system calls, I developed functionalities for creating and managing mailboxes, and mechanisms for task blocking and unblocking. Moreover, I integrated UART interrupts handling adeptly, which involved configuring and managing UART hardware to handle asynchronous data reception and transmission effectively. This was crucial in developing a simple terminal task that operates effectively in a laboratory setting, utilizing PuTTY as a terminal emulator to interact with the operating system. This project was not just a technical challenge but a substantial learning curve that deepened my understanding of operating systems' internal workings and their critical components.            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={1}>P1: Memory Management</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In the first phase of the MementoOS project, I concentrated on developing robust memory management support within the kernel and crafting comprehensive test cases to evaluate the system's design. My work involved using the ARM DS IDE for editing, debugging, and executing the RTX code, which provided the necessary tools for optimizing the debugging process and ensuring efficient implementation. I designed and implemented a first-fit memory management scheme, selecting this method for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling variable task memory usage patterns. To validate this system, I developed extensive test cases that covered a range of scenarios from basic single-thread allocations to more complex multi-thread interactions. This rigorous testing ensured that the memory management module could manage diverse and concurrent demands effectively, setting a strong foundation for further development within MementoOS. This phase not only bolstered the system's reliability but also enhanced my skills in low-level system operations and use of industry-standard development tools.

            <Title level={3}>k mem init - initialize the dynamic memory manager</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In my project, I developed the k_mem_init() function to initialize the RTX’s memory manager. This function sets up the initial state of memory management where the entire available memory, excluding the OS image, is considered a single free region. As memory is allocated and deallocated through k_mem_alloc and k_mem_dealloc, this continuous space is dynamically partitioned into free and allocated regions. I designed data structures to efficiently track these regions, keeping in mind that the size of these structures impacts the overall memory overhead. Therefore, minimizing their size was crucial to reduce the memory footprint of each allocation.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            The function successfully returns RTX_OK when initialization proceeds without issues, but it will return RTX_ERR if it fails due to insufficient free space. On the DE1-SoC, which comes with 1 GiB of memory, the usable memory for the RTX begins after the OS image, marked by the linker-generated variable Image$$ZI_DATA$$ZI$$ZI_Limit, and extends to RAM_END. My responsibility included not only implementing the memory management logic but also ensuring that the data structures for tracking memory usage were optimally designed to handle modifications efficiently, such as incorporating memory region ownership in Lab 2. This foundational setup is crucial as it supports the complex memory management requirements of a multitasking operating system.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k mem alloc - allocate dynamic memory</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            While developing the MementoOS, I implemented the k_mem_alloc() function, which is crucial for allocating dynamic memory. This function is designed to allocate a specified number of bytes using the first-fit algorithm and returns a pointer to the start of the allocated memory region. It's essential that the k_mem_init() function is called prior to any allocation requests; otherwise, k_mem_alloc() will return NULL. The argument size specifies the amount of memory requested, and the function returns the address of a consecutive memory region that matches this request. All allocated memory addresses are aligned to four bytes for efficiency and system compatibility. If the size requested is zero, the function also returns NULL, adhering to standard memory allocation practices where no memory segment is reserved. Moreover, the allocated memory is not initialized, which means that the content of the newly allocated memory region isn't set to zero, reflecting a performance optimization as it avoids unnecessary operations. The function will return a pointer to the allocated memory if successful or NULL if it fails, which typically occurs if the system cannot fulfill the memory request due to insufficient free memory. This functionality is pivotal in managing dynamic memory allocation efficiently within our multitasking operating system environment.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k mem dealloc - Free dynamic memory</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In the development of MementoOS, I implemented the k_mem_dealloc() function, which is essential for managing system memory efficiently by freeing up dynamic memory allocations. This function is designed to release the memory space that was previously allocated with k_mem_alloc(). It takes a pointer ptr to the memory space to be freed. If ptr has already been freed or was not initially allocated by k_mem_alloc(), the function returns RTX_ERR to indicate an error due to invalid or redundant deallocation requests. Additionally, if ptr is NULL, the function takes no action, ensuring that no undefined behavior occurs from attempting to free a non-existent memory address.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            A key feature of this function is its ability to perform immediate coalescence. This means that if the freed memory region is adjacent to other free regions, they are merged right away. This immediate merging helps maintain a clean and organized free memory space, reducing fragmentation and making it easier to manage and allocate future memory requests efficiently. The merged free memory is then reintegrated back into the system's pool of available memory.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            The k_mem_dealloc() function does not clear the contents of the freed memory region, which aligns with common practices in low-level memory management to optimize performance by eliminating unnecessary operations. The function returns RTX_OK on successful deallocation and integration of the memory back into the free pool, or RTX_ERR if it fails to free the memory for reasons such as the memory not being previously allocated or already freed. This method ensures the robustness and reliability of memory management within our multitasking operating system. 
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k mem dealloc - Free dynamic memory</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In the development of MementoOS, I introduced a utility function named k_mem_count_extfrag designed to help monitor and manage memory fragmentation effectively. This function plays a critical role in understanding memory usage patterns, particularly focusing on the external fragmentation of the system's memory.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            The k_mem_count_extfrag function's primary purpose is to count the number of free (unallocated) memory regions that are smaller than a specified size in bytes. This size is passed as an argument to the function. An important aspect to consider is that the space occupied by memory-management data structures within each free region is still counted as free. This approach ensures that the function provides a realistic view of the usable free memory segments that could potentially be too small to satisfy future allocation requests due to external fragmentation.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Operational Context: For instance, if the memory is segmented into various regions where some are occupied by the memory manager’s own data structures (marked in grey), free spaces (marked in white), and already-allocated memory regions (marked in blue), this function helps identify how many of those free regions are below a certain threshold. This is crucial for optimizing memory allocation strategies and for debugging issues related to memory insufficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Example Scenario: When k_mem_count_extfrag is called with arguments like 12, 42, and 43 bytes, the function will evaluate the current memory layout and return counts of free regions smaller than these sizes. In a hypothetical memory state, calling this function with these inputs might return 0, 2, and 3, respectively, indicating how fragmented the memory is at different segment sizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Implementation and Usage: The function is implemented in a way that iterates through the memory regions, comparing each free segment's size to the input argument and counting those that are strictly smaller. This utility is not only helpful in assessing the memory's health and fragmentation but also serves as a diagnostic tool to guide system optimizations and memory management strategies. By understanding external fragmentation more clearly, system developers can adjust their memory allocation and deallocation approaches to minimize waste and improve the overall efficiency of the system.
                    </li>

            <Title level={1}>P2: Task Management</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In this lab, I enhanced the MementoOS project by developing a preemptive multi-tasked kernel, focusing on sophisticated task management capabilities. I implemented system calls for managing tasks, scheduling, and preemption, alongside adapting existing memory management system calls to incorporate memory ownership. This involved designing a robust system structure to efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously, ensuring tasks transition smoothly between various states like ready, running, and blocked. I also developed a priority-based scheduler to allocate CPU time effectively, prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance, which is crucial for applications requiring timely responses. The introduction of task preemption allowed the system to interrupt a running task to start a higher priority task immediately, enhancing the OS's responsiveness. Modifying memory management to support task-specific ownership ensured that each task could only access its allocated memory, increasing the system's security and stability. This work not only reinforced my skills in kernel-level programming but also deepened my understanding of critical operating system functionalities necessary for modern multitasking environments, making MementoOS more robust and efficient.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k tsk create - create a user task:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            I developed the k_tsk_create function to facilitate the creation of user tasks at runtime. This function is essential for dynamically managing tasks within the operating system, allowing each new task to be assigned a unique Task ID (TID). The TIDs range from 0 to N-1, where N is determined by the MAX_TASKS macro defined in the common.h file, with TID 0 reserved specifically for the null task. Upon successfully creating a task, the function assigns the TID to the buffer indicated by the task parameter.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            The task_entry parameter specifies the entry point of the task, essentially the function that the task will execute. The prio argument sets the task's initial priority, constrained between 1 and 254, with PRIO_NULL (255) and PRIO_RT (0) reserved and hence not permissible for use. The stack_size argument, which must be a multiple of 8, dictates the size of the user-space stack in bytes. As part of this function, the kernel is responsible not only for allocating this stack but also for freeing it when the task terminates, at which point the kernel becomes the owner of the stack space.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            The k_tsk_create function returns RTX_OK if the task is successfully created, or RTX_ERR if it fails due to reasons such as reaching the maximum number of allowable tasks, inappropriate stack sizes, invalid priority levels, or null inputs for task or task_entry. It's important to note that while the calling task does not block when executing k_tsk_create, it can be preempted, which aligns with the behavior described in the scheduler function.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            In terms of task management within MementoOS, it's crucial that user tasks do not directly call k_tsk_create; instead, they should use the tsk_create system call which then traps into the kernel to execute k_tsk_create. Kernel tasks, on the other hand, directly invoke k_tsk_create. This distinction ensures proper task management and security within the kernel environment. Additionally, modifications to the task control block (TCB) data structure require careful adjustments to reflect changes in the kernel stack pointer offset, ensuring that the system maintains accurate track of each task's stack usage. This function is a cornerstone of task lifecycle management in MementoOS, enabling dynamic task handling and robust system functionality.

            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k tsk exit - terminate the calling task:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            I implemented the k_tsk_exit() function, which is crucial for managing the lifecycle of tasks within the operating system. This function is designed to terminate the currently running task, effectively stopping its operations and removing it from the system's active task list. When a task calls this function, it is immediately stopped and its state is set to DORMANT, provided its Task Control Block (TCB) still exists within the system's memory structure
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            The primary role of k_tsk_exit() is to ensure that once a task is terminated, the operating system can efficiently transition to another task without delay. This is critical for maintaining system responsiveness and resource allocation efficiency. After a task is terminated, the Real-Time Executive (RTX) is responsible for scheduling another task to run. In situations where no other tasks are ready to execute, the null task, which is always ready by design, will be scheduled to ensure that the CPU does not remain idle.

            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            One of the key features of the k_tsk_exit() function is that it does not return a value. This is because the function's operation is terminal for the calling task—once it is invoked, the task ceases to exist in its previous form, and control is transferred back to the RTX scheduler to determine the next course of action. This design ensures seamless task transitions and optimizes the overall task management process within the kernel.

            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
            This function is integral to the robust task management capabilities of MementoOS, allowing for dynamic task termination and efficient system resource management. Its implementation not only enhances the kernel's ability to handle multitasking environments but also strengthens the reliability and stability of the operating system.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k tsk set prio - set task priority at runtime:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            I implemented the k_tsk_set_prio() function, which is essential for dynamic task management within the operating system. This function allows the system or users to adjust the priority of tasks at runtime, enhancing the system's adaptability and responsiveness to workload changes.

The k_tsk_set_prio() function is designed to modify the priority of a task, identified by task_id, to a new priority level specified by the prio argument. The valid range for priority levels is between 1 and 254, with PRIO_NULL (255) and PRIO_RT (0) being reserved and not permissible for use. This function ensures flexibility in task management by allowing user tasks to change the priority of other user tasks, including their own, but restricts them from altering the priority of kernel tasks. Conversely, kernel tasks possess the capability to adjust the priority of any task, whether it is another kernel task or a user task.

An important design aspect of this function is that the priority of the null task, which acts as a system default task always ready to run when no other tasks are available, is fixed at PRIO_NULL and cannot be changed. This ensures there is always a predictable fallback task with the lowest priority.

When k_tsk_set_prio() is invoked, it does not block the calling task, which means the system remains responsive; however, the calling task could be preempted if a higher priority task becomes ready to run, maintaining efficient task scheduling as described in the RTX scheduler function.

The function returns RTX_OK if the priority change is successful, signaling that the inputs were valid and the operation was permitted. If the function fails due to invalid inputs, such as an incorrect task_id, an invalid prio, or an attempt to change a disallowed priority, it returns RTX_ERR. This return mechanism provides immediate feedback on the success of the operation, allowing for robust error handling and system stability.

Overall, the k_tsk_set_prio() function is a crucial component of the MementoOS’s task management system, offering necessary controls to optimize task execution based on changing system requirements and enhancing the overall efficiency of the operating system.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k tsk get info - obtain task information from the kernel:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In my work on the MementoOS project, I was responsible for creating the `k_tsk_get_info()` function, which is a key component of the system's task management suite. This function is designed to fetch and relay detailed information about any given task within the system, enhancing transparency and enabling better system monitoring and debugging.

The `k_tsk_get_info()` function operates by filling a `rtx_task_info` structure with data about a specified task. This structure is defined within the `common.h` file in the source directory and includes several critical fields about task status, priority, stack usage, and more as outlined in the system documentation. The task whose information is to be retrieved is specified by `task_id`, and the details are stored in a buffer passed to the function.

To execute, the function first checks the validity of the `task_id` and the non-null nature of the buffer pointer. If either of these checks fails, the function immediately returns `RTX_ERR`, indicating a failure due to invalid input parameters such as an unrecognized `task_id` or a null pointer for the buffer. This design ensures that the function only operates with valid and proper inputs, thus safeguarding against data corruption and system crashes that might arise from invalid memory access.

Upon successful validation of inputs, the function proceeds to populate the `rtx_task_info` structure with the current data of the specified task, drawing from various internal system resources and task management structures. This includes information like the current state of the task (running, blocked, etc.), its priority level, memory allocation specifics, and other operational parameters crucial for system operations and diagnostics.

The return value of `RTX_OK` indicates that the task information has been successfully retrieved and stored in the provided buffer, allowing the caller to use this data for further processing, analysis, or display. This functionality is particularly useful for system administrators and developers who need to monitor task behaviors and system performance closely, providing them with a powerful tool for optimizing the operating system's efficiency and stability.

Overall, the `k_tsk_get_info()` function is a vital utility in the MementoOS project, enhancing the kernel's capability to provide detailed and specific task-related information on demand, thereby supporting comprehensive system management and optimization efforts.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k tsk get tid - obtain TID of the calling task:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In the development of MementoOS, one of the functions I implemented was `k_tsk_get_tid()`, designed to enhance the system's introspective capabilities by allowing tasks to retrieve their own Task ID (TID). This functionality is crucial for tasks that need to reference themselves in a system where tasks frequently interact with each other and the kernel.

The `k_tsk_get_tid()` function is straightforward in its operation; it simply retrieves the TID of the task that calls the function. This is achieved by accessing the task's control block, where the TID is stored as part of the task's metadata. The retrieval process is optimized to be quick and efficient, minimizing the overhead associated with such system calls, which is crucial for maintaining the system's performance.

Using `k_tsk_get_tid()`, a task can easily obtain its identifier, which is essential for operations such as requesting specific resources, interacting with other tasks, or managing permissions and security settings. The TID serves as a unique identifier within the kernel, allowing the system to manage tasks individually and maintain a detailed record of task states and activities.

The function does not require any parameters, as it inherently operates on the context of the calling task, and it returns the TID directly. This simplicity ensures that tasks can retrieve their TIDs without the need to pass any additional information, simplifying the API and reducing potential errors.

The implementation of `k_tsk_get_tid()` in MementoOS has been instrumental in providing tasks with the ability to self-reference efficiently. This capability supports more complex task interactions and enhances the overall robustness of task management within the kernel. It's a small yet critical component of the operating system, contributing to the detailed management and operational transparency that is essential in modern OS design.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>scheduler - return the highest-priority runable task:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In my role within the MementoOS project, I was tasked with developing the `scheduler()` function, a critical component designed to manage the execution of tasks based on their priorities. This function is pivotal in implementing a strict-priority scheduling algorithm, where the highest-priority runnable task is always selected for execution.

The `scheduler()` function operates by continuously evaluating the set of runnable tasks—those that are not terminated and are eligible for execution. It maintains a ready queue where tasks are organized based on their priority levels; tasks with the same priority are sorted according to their arrival in the queue, adhering to a first-come-first-serve discipline.

This function is invoked every time there is a change in the task state, which could be due to various reasons such as task creation, task exit, a task yielding, or a priority change. For instance, when a task is created or when a task's priority is altered, the scheduler assesses whether the new or updated task should preempt the currently running task based on its priority. If a task with a higher priority than the currently running task is introduced or modified, it will preempt the current task, which is then placed back into the ready queue at a position that reflects its priority.

Handling priority changes is particularly delicate. If a task raises its own priority and it becomes the highest priority in the system, it continues running. However, if it does not surpass the highest-priority task in the queue, it will be preempted. Similarly, when a task yields, it will continue only if its priority is higher than any other task in the ready queue; otherwise, it will be preempted by the task with the highest priority.

The return value of the `scheduler()` function is a pointer to the Task Control Block (TCB) of the highest-priority runnable task. This ensures that the system always knows which task should be running at any given time, maintaining efficient and responsive task management.

The design and performance of the scheduler are crucial for the overall performance of the RTX. Therefore, careful consideration is given to the choice of data structures and algorithms used to manage the ready queue, aiming to optimize operations like adding, removing, and sorting tasks. This focus on efficiency helps minimize scheduling latency and maximizes system throughput, ensuring that MementoOS operates smoothly and effectively in managing multiple tasks.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={1}>P3: Inter-task Communications and I/O</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In my work on the MementoOS project, I focused on enhancing inter-task communications and managing UART interrupts, crucial for the system's efficiency and robustness. I developed a mailbox API to facilitate secure message exchanges between tasks, and implemented functionalities to block and unblock tasks, ensuring optimal resource utilization and task synchronization. Additionally, I handled UART interrupts to improve interactions with external devices and developed a simple terminal task that allows user interactions via a command-line interface. These enhancements were integral to advancing the real-time capabilities and user-friendliness of MementoOS.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k mbx create - create a mailbox:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In developing the MementoOS project, I was tasked with implementing the mailbox creation functionality, essential for task-specific communication. My role involved creating the `k_mbx_create` function, which establishes a mailbox for the calling task. The specified size of the mailbox determines its capacity to hold messages and the necessary metadata for management by the kernel. 

To ensure efficient message retrieval and storage, I adopted a first-come-first-served policy and implemented the mailbox as a ring buffer, or circular queue, to optimize space usage and performance. This design choice facilitates seamless message cycling without the need for shifting elements, making it highly efficient for the system's communication needs.

Ownership of the memory allocated for each task’s mailbox resides with the kernel, ensuring that resources are properly managed and released. When a task exits, it's crucial that the kernel deallocates the memory associated with its mailbox to prevent resource leakage.

The `k_mbx_create` function returns `RTX_OK` on successful mailbox creation, but it can fail under conditions such as the task already possessing a mailbox, the specified size being below the minimum threshold (`MIN_MBX_SIZE`), or insufficient runtime memory to accommodate the new mailbox. This robust handling ensures that the system remains stable and responsive under various operational conditions.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k send msg - send a message to the mailbox of a task:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            In my work on the MementoOS project, I implemented the `k_send_msg` function, which is critical for enabling tasks to communicate efficiently through messages. This function allows a task to send a message, contained within a buffer, to another task's mailbox, identified by the receiver's task ID (`receiver_tid`). The function handles various scenarios effectively, ensuring robust message delivery mechanisms within the operating system.

The message delivery process begins with checking the state of the receiving task. If the task is blocked awaiting a message (state `BLK_MSG`), the function unblocks it, potentially leading to a priority-based preemption if the unblocked task has a higher priority than the currently running task. If the unblocked task's priority is not higher, it is simply placed at the back of the ready queue, maintaining system stability and fairness.

Each message includes a standard header, as defined in the system specifications, which details the length and type of the message. These types are varied, ranging from general-purpose messages (`DEFAULT`) to specific control messages like `KCD_REG` for command registration and `KEY_IN` for keyboard inputs. This structure allows for diverse and dynamic communication needs within the system.

Messages are handled carefully to ensure integrity and system compatibility. The kernel is responsible for copying the message data into the receiver’s mailbox, considering any necessary metadata, such as the sender's task ID or other header information, ensuring that messages are delivered intact and with relevant context.

On the failure handling front, the `k_send_msg` function returns `RTX_OK` when a message is successfully sent or `RTX_ERR` on various failures such as non-existent or dormant receiver tasks, absence of a mailbox, or insufficient mailbox space. This robust error handling is crucial for maintaining system reliability and aiding in debugging and system maintenance.

This implementation not only supports efficient task communication but also reinforces system robustness through careful handling of task states and message prioritization, vital for the real-time performance and reliability of the MementoOS.
            </Paragraph>
            <Title level={3}>k recv msg - receive a message:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
            I implemented the `k_recv_msg` function, which plays a critical role in the operating system's inter-task communication by enabling tasks to receive messages from their respective mailboxes. This function is designed to support robust messaging capabilities within the system, ensuring tasks can communicate efficiently and effectively.

The `k_recv_msg` function allows a task to receive a message stored in its mailbox. If a message is available, it is retrieved and the buffer `buf` provided by the calling task is filled with the message content. The length of this buffer is specified by the `len` argument, and it is crucial that it is sufficiently large to accommodate the incoming message. If the buffer is too small, the message at the top of the queue is discarded, and the function returns a failure.

If the mailbox is empty when a task calls this function, the task enters a blocked state (`BLK_MSG`) and does not return to the ready queue until a message is received. This state management ensures that the system's resources are allocated efficiently and that high-priority tasks can run without unnecessary delays.

Furthermore, if the `sender_tid` parameter is not a null pointer, it is filled with the ID of the task that sent the message, providing context about the message's origin. This feature is optional and can be bypassed if `sender_tid` is passed as a null pointer, indicating that the receiving task does not require sender identification.

The system adheres to a first-come-first-served policy for message delivery, ensuring fairness and order in message handling. When a task becomes blocked due to an empty mailbox, the scheduler is called upon to activate the highest-priority task in the ready queue, maintaining the system’s responsiveness and task prioritization.

The `k_recv_msg` function returns `RTX_OK` on successful message receipt or `RTX_ERR` on failures, such as when the calling task lacks a mailbox or the buffer is incorrectly sized. This rigorous error handling is critical for preventing miscommunications and ensuring system stability.

Overall, my implementation of the `k_recv_msg` function is an essential component of the MementoOS, enhancing its capability to manage inter-task communications effectively, and is critical for the system’s overall performance and reliability.
