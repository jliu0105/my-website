            <Paragraph>
            Welcome to the Google Stock Price Prediction project! This system uses advanced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to forecast future stock prices of Google based on its historical data. By utilizing deep learning techniques tailored for time series analysis, this project offers insights to understand market trends and assist in making informed investment decisions.

            <Title level={3}>1. Machine Learning Model:</Title>
            <Paragraph>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM Cells: At the core of this project is an LSTM-based RNN, which is designed to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in time series data. LSTMs are ideal for predicting stock prices as they can retain information for long durations, crucial in understanding how past data influences future prices.

            <Paragraph>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Data Collection: The dataset includes daily stock prices of Google, focusing primarily on the 'Open' price for training and predictions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Normalization: Stock prices are scaled using MinMaxScaler to normalize the data within a range of 0 to 1, optimizing neural network performance and aiding in faster convergence during training.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Sequence Creation: Training data is formatted into sequences, where each input sequence (comprising the last 60 days' data) predicts the stock price for the next day. This sequencing is vital for the LSTM model to learn the pattern in historical price movements.

                    <li>
                    Model Architecture: The LSTM model includes multiple layers, each followed by dropout layers to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.

                    <li>
                    Compilation and Optimization: The model uses the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, typical for regression problems in neural networks.

                    <li>
                    Stock Price Prediction: The model forecasts stock prices for designated test days. These predictions are then inverse-transformed to revert the scaling and derive the actual price forecasts.

                    <li>
                    Visualization: Predicted and actual prices are plotted using matplotlib, providing a visual comparison to highlight the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy.
